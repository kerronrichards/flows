Procedural vs Substantive

Program Analysts focus on procedural errors (entities, descriptions, ownership).

Management team may focus on substantive issues (e.g., §2(a) concerns).

D. Oversight & Quality Review

Quality Review

Supervisor (Heather) conducts QA:

Confirms analysts entered blemish queries correctly.

Randomly reviews other records for missed errors.

Appeals Process

Law Offices may email appeals (e.g., request not to query similar cases).

Supervisor or analyst reviews appeal, verifies query origin, and responds.

E. Reporting & Metrics

Tracking

Spreadsheet formulas track assignments, % complete, errors, and queries reviewed.

Each analyst typically has 25 queries reviewed weekly (supplemental reviewer = 50).

Volume Management

Normal cap: ~11,000 records per OG issue.

Currently raised to ~13,000, requiring overtime.

Overtime tracked alongside productivity metrics.

Entry/Exit

Entry: OG issue published → records loaded → assignments made.

Exit: Queries entered in EOG, QA performed, appeals resolved, tracking updated.
